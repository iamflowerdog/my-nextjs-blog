Hello, my name is Yang. I am 34 years old and work in a Japanese tech industry. I have already taken some English courses on this platform before.
I have two daughters, Bella (6 years old) and Coco (4 years old). I want to improve my English speaking skills to communicate better at work and help my daughters learn English.

## 1. My Current English Level
- My current English level is around **A2**.
- I want to start preparing for **IELTS Speaking** in the future.
- I can understand basic daily English and simple conversations.
- I want to improve **fluency**, **pronunciation**, and **natural speaking for IELTS topics**.
- Sometimes I pause too much and rely on simple words. I hope to expand my vocabulary.

## 2. My Learning Goals
- Speak more confidently in real-life situations.
- Expand vocabulary that I can actually use.
- Reduce common grammar mistakes.
- Improve listening during faster conversations.
- Gradually build skills needed for IELTS speaking.

## 3. What I Prefer in Class
- Please speak at a **moderate speed**.
- Let me finish speaking first, then correct my mistakes.
- Give me **better sentence suggestions** when my expressions are unnatural.
- Teach me **3 useful words or phrases** each class.
- Provide simple IELTS-related speaking practice when possible.

## 4. Topics I Want to Practice
- Daily life & small talk  
- Work-related conversations  
- Talking about my family (I have two daughters, Bella and Coco)  
- Travel, hobbies, and storytelling  
- Beginner-level IELTS topics (weather, hometown, work, habits, etc.)
