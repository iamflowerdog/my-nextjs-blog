# 软件工程

### 转山App

My "native" programming language, I've worked with it for over 6 years. I've used it in the front-end with React and Redux, in the back-end for APIs with Node, Express and Hapi.js and for testing automation using Mocha and later on, Jest.

### Golang

I've started learning it recently and found it challenging (in a good way!) I'm not proficient yet but I've worked on some features and fixes on my own.

### Technical writing

I enjoy writing about technical subjects and I feel I can do a pretty good job about it! My motivation is explaining things in simple and practical terms and thus making things easier for others.
